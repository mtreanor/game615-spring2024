## Description
This course introduces students to computer game development, techniques, implementation, and programming. While much of the course focuses on technical and programming skills including key game algorithms, artificial intelligence, graphics, and interface design, students are also exposed to the artistic and production-oriented aspects of game development. Working in small groups, students design and develop a game.
